            This HTML produces the same output as shown earlier in Figure 1-13. The difference is that now each
            <section>
            element creates a new page section rather than rely on the header elements to create the sections. Screen readers
                can parse the semantic elements to create the document outline and eventually can provide a much richer user
                experience because of how HTML5 allows webpage designers to lay out the pages. From the Library of Ida Schander
                20 CHAPTER 1 Implement and manipulate document structures and objects Objective summary ■■ HTML5 introduced
                new semantic elements to more clearly define sections of an HTML page. These elements include
                <section>,
                    <article>,
                        <nav>,
                            <header>,
                                <footer>,
                                    <aside>,
                                        <progress>,
                                            <mark>,
                                                <figure>, and
                                                    <figcaption>. ■■ Elements within an HTML page can have their layout controlled when
                                                        they are included inside structures such as
                                                        <div> elements and/or HTML tables. ■■ HTML5 semantic elements provide the
                                                            mechanisms necessary to structure the page more easily for accessibility
                                                            via screen readers. ■■ Search engines take advantage of HTML5
                                                            semantics by leveraging the
                                                            <article>
                                                                element to determine the purpose of the page.
